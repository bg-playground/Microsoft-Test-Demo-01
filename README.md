## Testing Lifecycle Demonstration
This repository demonstrates the following stages of the testing lifecycle:
1. **Test Planning**: Documentation and strategies are defined in `/docs/testing_strategy`.
2. **Test Design**: Test cases and scenarios are outlined in `/tests`.
3. **Test Execution**: Automated scripts run tests defined within the `/tests` directory.
4. **Test Reporting**: Results and logs generated during the test execution process for analysis.
