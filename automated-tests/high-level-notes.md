   - Maintain clear and concise test cases.
   - Use descriptive naming conventions.
   - Regularly review and refactor tests to keep them relevant.

5. **Continuous Integration**: Scripts are integrated with CI/CD pipelines for automated execution upon code commits and pull requests.

6. **Reporting**: Generate reports for test results to identify failures quickly and track progress over time.

7. **Maintenance**: Keep scripts updated with application changes to ensure ongoing reliability of tests.
